Think about what makes something equal to zero when you're multiplying things together.\n\nOkay, so you see we have two things multiplied together: (2x + 3) and (x - 5). The whole thing equals zero. What does that tell you?\n\nðŸ’¡ **Hint 2:** Which concept or formula applies? **The Zero Product Property** says that if the product of two or more factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.\n\nThat's right! The Zero Product Property is our key here. It basically means that if we have something times something else equals zero, then *either* the first thing equals zero, *or* the second thing equals zero (or both!).\n\nðŸ’¡ **Hint 3:** What is the final step before solving? Set up two separate equations.\n\nExactly! We need to split our one equation into two separate equations.\n\nâœ… **Final Answer:**\nx = -3/2, x = 5\n\nðŸ“˜ **Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1.  **Apply the Zero Product Property:**\n    Since (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0, we know that either (2x + 3) = 0 OR (x - 5) = 0.\n\n2.  **Set up two separate equations:**\n    *   Equation 1: 2x + 3 = 0\n    *   Equation 2: x - 5 = 0\n\n3.  **Solve Equation 1 (2x + 3 = 0):**\n    *   Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = -3\n    *   Divide both sides by 2: x = -3/2\n\n4.  **Solve Equation 2 (x - 5 = 0):**\n    *   Add 5 to both sides: x = 5\n\n5.  **Combine the solutions:**\n\n    So, the solutions are x = -3/2 and x = 5. That means if you plug either of those values back into the original equation, it will equal zero!\n\nGreat job! You got it. Let me know if you'd like to try another problem.",

The Zero Product Property tells us that if two things multiplied together equal zero, then at least one of those things *must* be zero.  So, we can break our problem into two simpler problems:\n\n    *   Either (2x + 3) = 0\n    *   Or (x - 5) = 0\n\n3.  **Solve the First Equation (2x + 3 = 0):**\n\n    *   Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n        2x + 3 - 3 = 0 - 3\n        2x = -3\n    *   Divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x':\n        2x / 2 = -3 / 2\n        x = -3/2\n\n4.  **Solve the Second Equation (x - 5 = 0):**\n\n    *   Add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n        x - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5\n        x = 5\n\n5.  **The Solutions:** We found two possible values for 'x' that make the original equation true:\n\n    *   x = -3/2\n    *   x = 5\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = -3/2 and x = 5. You can check these by plugging them back into the original equation to see if they make it equal zero!\n\nGreat job working through this problem! Let me know if you have any other questions. We can go through it again, or try something new.",

When do you get zero as an answer when multiplying? What should the student try first?\n\nðŸ’¡ Hint 2: Which concept or formula applies?\n\nGreat! You're on the right track. The concept we need to use here is the **Zero Product Property**. This property states that if the product of two or more factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. In other words, if a * b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0 (or both).\n\nðŸ’¡ Hint 3: What is the final step before solving?\n\nPerfect!

This is great because it allows us to use the Zero Product Property.\n\n2.  **Set each factor equal to zero:**  The Zero Product Property tells us that either (2x + 3) = 0 or (x - 5) = 0 (or both). So, we set up two separate equations:\n\n    *   2x + 3 = 0\n    *   x - 5 = 0\n\n3.  **Solve the first equation (2x + 3 = 0):**\n\n    *   Subtract 3 from both sides:  2x = -3\n    *   Divide both sides by 2:  x = -3/2\n\n4.  **Solve the second equation (x - 5 = 0):**\n\n    *   Add 5 to both sides: x = 5\n\n5.  **Write the solutions:** The solutions to the equation (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0 are x = -3/2 and x = 5.\n\nAnd that's it! You've successfully solved the equation. Remember, the Zero Product Property is a powerful tool when dealing with factored equations. Keep practicing, and you'll become a pro in no time!",
